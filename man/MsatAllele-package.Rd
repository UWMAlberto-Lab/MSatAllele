\title{
Visualizes and scores microsatellite alleles from electrophoresis fragment sizes}
\description{
	The package contains functions to: 1) load ah files from Strand software and build a R data base; 2) plot different
	graphical displays of the fragment sizes obtained for each locus and their bins; 3) interact with graphs to sort the data
	base for a given locus and range, allowing to easily trace back a particular group of samples to its original Strand file; bin
	fragment size data into population genetics files. 5) From version 1.04 on, the user can set manually bin limits
	and write files combining the manual and automatic methods to bin alleles.
